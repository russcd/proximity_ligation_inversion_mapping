# proximity_ligation_inversion_mapping

# Overview:

This repository contains scripts for mapping inversion breakpoints using proximity ligation (Hi-C) sequencing data and a simple two-parameter optimization algorithm. An evaluation of the properties of this approach and application to fine-mapping inversion breakpoints of the An. gambiae species complex is availble from our preprint here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/662114v1.abstract. Here, we focus on practical details associated with using our implementation.
